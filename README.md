# Introduction

**NCVX** (NonConVeX) is a user-friendly and scalable python software package targeting general nonsmooth NCVX problems with nonsmooth constraints. **NCVX** is being developed by [GLOVEX](https://glovex.umn.edu/) at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

The initial release of NCVX contains the solver **PyGRANSO**, a PyTorch-enabled port of GRANSO incorporating auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, tensor input, and support for new QP solvers. As a highlight, **PyGRANSO** can solve general constrained deep learning problems, the first of its kind.
